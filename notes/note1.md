Please note that when clients attempt to connect to Office 365, their computer’s DNS query determines the region of the world their computer is coming from, and Office 365 redirects the request to the nearest regional datacenter. Therefore, users in different geographical locations will resolve the same FDQN to different IP addresses. The example provided here assumes that customer A and customer B are in the same geographical area. The goal of this example is only to show that the same Office 365 endpoints are accessed by customers with and without ExpressRoute. See paragraph “ER-friendly DNS resolution in globally distributed networks” for more information.
