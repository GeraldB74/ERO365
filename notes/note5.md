Please note that the Destination-NAT process described here statically maps a public IPv4 address to a private IPv4 address, which is why sometimes it is referred to as “Static NAT”. This should not be confused with SNAT or Source-NAT as described in the paragraph “Source-NAT for outbound connectivity”. In order to avoid any confusion, this document always uses the terms “Destination-NAT” and “Source-NAT”.
